Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

Example 1:

<img width="522" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ab0ef63-f062-48af-b392-904dcec74439" />

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]

Output: 10

Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.

The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

Example 2:

<img width="202" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5564701a-6266-41c0-8d21-6af5830a8a93" />

Input: heights = [2,4]

Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= heights.length <= 105

0 <= heights[i] <= 104
