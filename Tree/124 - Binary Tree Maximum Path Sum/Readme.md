A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

 

Example 1:


<img width="322" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5795469-75cf-4d35-b71e-2a85f3f00dbb" />

Input: root = [1,2,3]

Output: 6

Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:


<img width="431" height="302" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e701a732-da71-4610-aa94-f6e056650bdc" />

Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: 42

Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].

-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
